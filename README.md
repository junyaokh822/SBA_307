# School Website Project

## Description
A simple, playful school-themed website that helps students manage their school life. The website features a humorous home page with animated elements, a class schedule viewer, a bookbag items checklist, and user authentication pages (login and registration).  
Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap** for responsive design.

## Project Reflection

### 1. What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?
I could have drawn a wireframe for each page. Having a visual blueprint before coding would have made layout decisions much clearer and reduced the amount of trial-and-error during development.

### 2. Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What would make them easier in the future?
Centering elements using CSS properties was quite difficult. I need more practice and should create a general template to use in future projects. Gaining a stronger understanding of **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid** would also streamline this process.

### 3. What would you add or change if given more time?
I would likely add authentication that restricts access to certain parts of the website until a user registers and logs in. This would make the login and registration pages functional instead of static.

### 4. Notes for Future Reference
Always review previous projects to better understand which CSS properties affect which elements, classes, and tags. Building a personal reference library of commonly used CSS patterns will save time and reduce frustration in future development.
